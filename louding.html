            <p>The place of women basically refers to how women are viewed in society when it comes to their role status
                and
                position. The book vividly portrays how women are viewed. Faced with challenges, yet unable to voice
                their
                concerns due to cultural beliefs that they are nothing compared to men.
            </p>
            <p>
                Women in this village are being deprived of education, this is because they are viewed as assets who
                will be
                married off to men who will provide them with everything they want.
                We are introduced to a character called Adunni in the book, where she yearns for education but being
                that
                she
                is born a woman, she cannot achieve this because
                society claims that women are suppose to stay at home and when they reach a certain age they are going
                to be
                married off to men who will provide for them.
                This factor highly affects the girls from her village, where they are forced not to pursue their
                dreams,but
                they are encouraged to get married and have children.
                This factor not only affects Adunni but also some other women in their village. Adunni’s mother was
                affected
                by this in that she was forced to get married even before
                she could complete her education, which led her to get married to a man who made her lack happiness in
                her
                life. Another girl who faces this challenge of not being heard
                is Kiki the daughter to Morufu where she is forced to get married at a younger age having to throw away
                her
                dream of being a designer.

            </p>
            <p>
                In instances where the family is poor, they usually prioritize educating men over women because they
                believe
                that a woman would be married to another community,
                and it would be a poor investment because other people will benefit from their daughter’s education and
                empowerment. This has affected most communities worldwide
                where the families experience constraints.

            </p>
            <p>
                Women in this society are viewed as a source of wealth, which instigates the reason why they are being
                married off early. In that the parents know that when they are
                married to rich men, their family will not suffer from financial constraints because they have
                richin-laws
                who can fund their lives, and they will be able to
                get basic supplies. Khadija is one of the culprits who suffered this in that her family married her
                offto
                her man because they knew this man would be able to supply
                them with food and cater for their medical expenses.

            <h2>The place of women in society</h2>
            <p>"I know, I am just a girl, and girls like me no have mouth, no have voice, but no be silent"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
            Aduni is also affected when the father used to tell her
            that if she were married off to a rich man, their family
            would benefit more because their house rent would be catered for, and they would never lack food.
            Many families in Africa tend to view women as wealth because when they just hear a family has a daughteror
            many daughters, they tend to think about how the family will
            be rich when the dowry is being paid, hence this highly affects the people from this communities hence
            influencing early marriages in cases where the family wants an easy earned resources.

        </p>

        <p> Women are nothing without men. This is where we are introduced to Florence, yes, she had a husband, but then
            the husband used to depend on her for everything. She used to
            help her husband’s family and also give her husband stipends, but this did not make her husband to respect
            her simply because she is a woman. The husband does not have
            anything at all because he is being provided with everything by the woman, but then the society fails to
            acknowledge that because she is a woman, and she relies on her
            husband for her to be acknowledged in society as an important person.

        </p>

        <p>This is a common scenario in that there is a premonition that women are weak; therefore, they need men in
            their lives. A common relation point is when we have the election
            for presidency, if a woman vies and a man also vies, the chances of a woman failing are high because they
            are viewed to be inferior to men. In as much as there are countries
            led by women but it really takes a lot to be able to compete with a man in the presidential seat and emerge
            as winner because the society sees women as somewhat weak and not
            wise enough to lead a group of men as men tend to think they are highly superior. Even in companies, we tend
            to find men in the president, or rather the CEO's position, and women
            the vice president because apparently "women cannot lead men".

    <div id="tradition">
        <div class="culture-background">
            <h2>Traditional cultural beliefs</h2>
            <p>"If a woman is born a girl, she is born to suffer" </p>

        </div>

        <div class="cultural-beliefs">

            <p>Cultural beliefs affect people’s way of thinking, and this, in turn, ends up affecting the way people
                show up
                in life and the choices they make when they're in difficult situations.
                They also impact and intersect with spiritual and religious practice. In the book, we see how different
                people solve their problems using traditional ways, and some of them end up
                being hurt in the process and lose money too.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For instance, when Khadija feels unwell, she goes to her lover, Bamidele, because she believes that there
                is
                a curse upon their family and that bathing in a river seven times with a
                special soap will make her well, instead of going to the midwife. Bamidele says that every pregnant
                woman
                has to take a bath before nine months, or she will die while giving birth.
                She ends up dying beside the river because “Bamidele did not show up with the soap”.
            </p>


            <p>Tia’s mother-in-law suggests that she should take the bath so that she can have children, and she agrees
                to
                this, not because she wants to, but because she wants her to stop pestering her. When she goes to the
                shrine, she gets beaten, and they end up realizing that the husband is the one who is infertile, and yet
                the
                mother-in-law believed that she would get children after visiting the medicine man, and she even paid
                for
                it. In the current society in Kenya, especially in the Kisii and Kamba communities, most people believe
                in
                curses and traditional medicine. Some people in the community are avoided because
                they are believed to be witches, and even the people who just moved to that place avoid them without any
                specific reason as to why they are avoiding them.
                When a person gets sick, instead of going to the hospital, they go to shrines of certain medicine
                men,and
                they believe that it is better than going to the
                hospital and that they will get better. When a woman has daughters only and wants a son, she goes to the
                medicine man, and she believes that the next baby she will
                give birth to will be a boy. It is the same case with barren women; they believe that the medicine man
                will
                solve their issue and that they will be able to have children.
                People also go to the medicine man for general life issues like a lack of money and disputes in the
                family,
                because they see this as the best solution to their problems.
                The medicine men are paid, and the practice is their occupation. They are expensive, and sometimes
                whatever
                you went there for doesn’t work, and you end up losing money instead.

    <div id="marriage">

        <div class="marriage-text">

            <p>Child marriage is a human rights violation taking place on a vast scale in Africa, which
                disproportionately
                affects girls. Girls who are married at young age often drop out of school and
                face physical risks, especially during pregnancy. Due to the social, health, and economic impacts of
                child
                marriage, the practice is a major obstacle to sustainable development.
            </p>

            <p>In this book, in the village of Ikati, girls who are not even 15 years old are forced to marry just for
                the
                sake of their families to get money for food and rent. The girls
                have no choice over whom they marry and when to marry and this hinders their educational life because
                they
                are sold to men who are older than them for the sake of
                the survival of their families.
            </p>
            <p> By the story of Adunni, she dropped out of school after the death of her mother and was unable to
                continue
                due to the financial issues, and her dad who was a lazy man who
                didn't want to work, sold her only daughter to Morufu who had three wives, so that he could survive
                He thought that having a daughter was the only cure to his poverty, and Adunni had no choice but to go
                and
                live with a torturous man and other wives.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Adunni’s village, young girls like her have no other future but to marry. When they turn 14 years
                old,
                they are excited to marry because they don’t have any other life apart from being married off to men who
                are
                old enough to be their father. This limits these young girls from unlocking their potential and living
                their
                lives in general for example in the book there is a girl called khadija who was just married of to a man
                just because her family wanted a bag of rice and also morufu’s daughter who always dreamed of becoming a
                designer little did she know that her father saw her as a grown woman and she needed to marry mind you
                she
                was only fifteen, a little girl with dreams.

            </p>

            <p>Reflecting on today’s society, there are some parts of the world that still practice early marriage.
                Worldwide, more than 75 million young women aged 20 to 24 years, a quarter of them in Africa, entered
                their
                first marriage or union before they celebrated their 18th birthday. But the global profile of child
                marriage
                is changing. A growing child population combined with a slow decline in the practice of child marriage
                in
                Africa will put millions more girls at risk. If current trends continue, almost half of the world’s
                child
                brides in 2050 will be African. This statistical profile presents key facts about the past, present, and
                future of child marriage in Africa.

                <p>Education is a central theme of the book, highlighting the struggle of a young Nigerian girl, Adunni,
                    who
                    eagerly wants to gain an education and use her “louding” voice to advocate for herself and others.
                </p>
                <p>The journey started when Aduni’s mother was alive, she taught Adunni that her schooling is her voice.
                    As
                    a
                    result, Adunni spent her life searching for empowerment and self-esteem through education. However,
                    her
                    quest for knowledge was challenged by an abusive man and indentured servitude . Despite the dismal
                    circumstances and the cruel people who belittle her, she refused to stay silent and incurious,
                    instead
                    she
                    was finding ways to educate herself through small unintentional opportunities and passing the power
                    of
                    voice
                    along to others. Throughout her journey the novel suggested that education uniquely empowers one’s
                    self
                    worth, self awareness, confidence, and independence.
                </p>
                <p>Adunni’s mother influenced Adunni to acquire much knowledge which allowed her to be active and
                    purposeful
                    to
                    her surroundings. Her ability to use unintentional opportunities helped her to read two books ( The
                    Collins
                    English Dictionary and The Book of Nigerian Facts) when she was working as a housemaid for big
                    madam.
                    Adunni
                    consults these books frequently, using the dictionary to learn new words and The Book of Nigerian
                    Facts
                    to
                    learn more about Nigerian culture and society. Those whole experiences imbued Adduni with the
