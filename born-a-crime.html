                “Even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto <br> is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I've done enough”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="protagonist">
            <p>Patricia, Trevor Noah's mother, comes out as a strong and clever woman who thinks on her own and makes
                her own choices regardless of what the law states and what the rest of society thinks. </p>

            <p>Her resistance comes out very clearly when she decides that she wants to have a baby with a white man,
                despite it being a crime during the apartheid period. In that period, women could only work as maids,
                but she went ahead and took a secretarial course and went to the township, where she moved around
                disguising herself as a prostitute to avoid being questioned by the police for being in a white area.
                She was arrested many times, but she never went back home, and this is where she found Robert and
                decided that she wanted a baby with him, and so she asked for his sperm. From this, Trevor learns about
                resilience and how to overcome obstacles in life and not dwell on the problems, but to move on with life
                while being positive. Trevor was told how his mother was working hard, and this is exactly what he does
                when he starts working and fending for himself.</p>
            <p>Her strength and courage to ask for sperm brought Trevor into the world, and this is where his
                development begins. She goes ahead and shows her son that there are no limitations to what he could do.
                She takes him to the white neighbourhoods, and this changes Trevor's imagination, which contributes to
                his development because he is able to dream big. People thought that she was crazy for engaging in
                “white activities,” but she wanted Trevor to know that the ghetto is not the world and that he could go
                anywhere he wanted. She encouraged Trevor to form his own opinions and not to go with the flow.

    <h1>Feeling like an outsider</h1>

            <img src="pics/sddefault.jpg" alt="">
            <p>"It is easier to be an insider as an otsider than to be an outsider as an insider."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="outsider">
            <p>Trevor, being born of black and white parents, couldn't fit into any group. During break times at school,
                people would break into their cliques and group according to their respective colors, as people were
                grouped by skin color. Soccer was played by black kids. The white kids played tennis, while the kids who
                played cricket were a mix. The Chinese kids would hang out next to the prefab buildings, the South
                African seniors and the popular pretty girls each had their own hanging places. </p>

            <p>Trevor, being the only mixed kid out of a thousand, didn't know where to go. Even after having so many
                groups to choose from, he wasn't a natural constituent of a particular one. The colored kids would shit
                on him for being too black. He was adept enough with white kids not to get bullied. He got along with
                the poor black kids, but most of them took minibuses to school. They rode to school and back home as
                friends. They had their own groups.
                As I was reading this chapter, “OUTSIDER” in “ Born a Crime,” I had a feeling of deja vu. I
                think because I found myself living with people from different countries, just like Trevor living with
                people
                from different classes. Though we were all Africans and a few Indians in school, I still faced the
                challenge of
                fitting in. People spoke a different language and had a totally different culture, aside from what I
                know. I was
                termed as a foreigner and at the same time called black.
                I couldn't belong anywhere as I was the only one from my country and had no other person to play or talk
                to. And
                to make matters worse, the English I knew could only get me water for drinking if I were to be pushed on
                the
                battlefield for survival. I did not have friends, and it took me time to make friends. I missed school
                often so
                that I could avoid loneliness. I had to adapt to this situation and try to change it by learning English
                first,
                so I can communicate with people. I learnt the language after a while, and my active participation in
                school
                games helped me make friends with others. School life became a little bit better and worth living.

    <h1>Humor as Armor</h1>

            <p> “Laughter is an escape. I feel like laughter reminds you <br> of your best self, your favorite self,
                your freest self.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="humour">
            <p>In his book, Trevor Noah displays heavy and sad topics. He spoke about it in an easy-to-digest way,
                through humor. In the book, we see that his mother, Patricia, remarkably made their challenging life
                bearable through laughter and humor. In the book, Trevor says that, liife was a roller coaster, and
                Humour was the safety bar holding that was holding them together.Trevor acquires humor as a defining
                character trait and is seen using it in different ways to survive apartheid.</p>

            <p>Trevor was always locked up during apartheid because he did not belong anywhere due to his skin colour.
                This gave him a disadvantage in his early school life, where he found himself alone with no friends and
                socially isolated. Yet using humour, he is able to fit in with different groups by being the class
                clown. He was also able to connect with black kids, where he discovered he wanted to be identified as a
                black individual. Throughout the book, we see instances where Trevor and his mother turned difficult
                situations into moments of laughter, like when they jumped out of a moving car, or when the mother was
                in the intensive care bed after being shot in the head. In both instances, they laughed through their
                pain, finding the brighter side in the darkness of the situation.</p>

            <p>From Trevor's story, I am reminded of my best friend, who, once he opened up to me about his challenging
                childhood and was going through a rough patch with his father, to the point he ran away from home. Even
                though that was the most vulnerable topic he's ever spoken to me about, the manner in which he delivered
                it he delivered it had me laughing my ribs out, that's the kind of person he is, he finds humor in every
                situation.

        </div>

        <div class="thinking">
            <p>Patricia's thought for independence is termed powerful because she relies on herself for most things.
                Patricia decided to leave her home and family to go build a house of her own. When Patricia decided to
                conceive Trevor, her bravery and independence were the ones that cheered her to have a baby. This is not
                only depicted as bravery but also being confident to break through obstacles. Her courage and confidence
                made her get what she wanted. She knew what she wanted only by thinking for herself, therefore, she
                constantly encouraged Trevor to think for himself about what he wants. Hence, Trevor was able to learn
                how to think by himself.</p>

            <p>This influenced his career in various ways, as he learned this from his mother. When he started selling
                his CDs in the block he was able to think through it and see that being confined in one place was not
                bringing him any benefit. He had to think and come up with a solution that was meant to be
                substantial in his life and when he decided to move he was able to strategize on how he would make his
                decision not be impactful.
                When Trevor left his mother's house because he could not endure seeing his mother being beaten up, his
                mother encouraged him to live because she knew she had raised an independent soul who was able to make
                his own decisions, because she used to encourage him to practice independence and self-reliance. Even
                though he was leaving, he was confident enough because he knew he had thought it through.</p>

            <p>His ability to think for himself enabled him to be creative enough to a point
                where he was able to host shows and interviews, where he could flow well and share out his opinions and
                ideas
                without fearing to be judged by other people because he knew that most people are restricted by the
                society to
                be able to express their views. This was influenced by his mother, who constantly told him that he
                should not be
                limited by anything when it came to sharing your opinion, even if it is against societal norms, as long
                as your
                intention is not meant to harm other people. This helped Trevor build some level of confidence in
                himself, hence
                succeeding in his career.

            <h1>Love and relationship</h1>
            <p>“I understood even from an early age that we weren't just mother and son we were a team”
                Trevor spent most of his life with his mom. And she is the focal point of his love and admiration. His
                relationship with his mom is one of the relationships that made Trevor who he is, characterized by
                hardship, strength and humor. Trevor didn't only learn from her verbal definitions of what's good or bad
                but also from her actions.

                The way she wasn't obedient to her mother-in-law and didn't defer to her husband says a lot about her
                independence and how much she respects her tribe's values. Her Xhosa name means “She who gives back” and
                she proves to be generous many times throughout the book. Trevor grew up watching his mom give faith to
                God, give an education and protection to him, give money to her parents, and give personal and financial
                resources to her abusive husband.
            </p>

            <p>And when he grew up and started working, he shared his income with his friends. Having learned how to
                give just like his mom. Patricia was strict, and Trevor wasn't always on good behaviour and that made
                their relationship a bit fun.

                “Relationships are built in silence.”
                Some believe that for a relationship to exist, the people involved need to meet, see and talk to each
                other every day, but that isn't always the case. We could be away from people for years, and when we
                reconnect, it might feel as if we never parted. Trevor's relationship with his dad is one characterized
                by this dynamic. His father wasn't one for talking, so their relationship was built in silence.
                Sometimes, people don't have to tell you who they are; you can figure that out simply by spending time
                with them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Trevor had a close connection with his dog Fufi. He used to follow her around but this one time, she
                left him and went to another house. He actually mentions that she was the first female to break his
                heart. That's when he realised that we don't own the things we love. He tells this story to people when
                they tell him about losing people. Although personally I think that is a weak analogy.

                The traditional ideal often positions mother as a figure focused on domestic duties and raising children
                but Trevor's relationship with his mom opposes this. They're a team suggesting partnership and
                responsibility. The traditional view of relationship sometimes implies a degree of possessiveness. But
                as Trevor said “you love people but you don't own the.” This emphasizes the value of respecting the
                freedom of the people you love. The traditional way focuses solely on finding a suitable spouse where as
                Trevor sees relationships as opportunities to grow.
