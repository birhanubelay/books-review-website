            <h2>Raised by humour, Carried by her bravery</h2>
            <p>
                If given a chance to rename born a crime I would name it "Raised by humour, carried by her bravery"
                taking a look at the way trevor grew up he was boy full of humour I mean the way her mother would 
                try to punish him and it ended in a funny way full of humour letting him realize that the punishment 
                was full of her love. talking about the bravery of his mother she was a woman of hope who believed 
                that trevor deserved way more alot than she got the fact that she was black and had a kid with 
                a white man in those difficult times defines how she was able to do whatever that was right for her
            </p>
            <h3>Explaining the quote from "Born a crime"</h3>
            <p>
                Explaining the quote Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife...but he never fell
                in love with
                subservient women...'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"
                Seeing the light in someone, but wanting to dim it. Some men are attracted to strong,
                independent women not because they value that freedom, but because winning over it
                feeds their ego. The cage isn't always physical it's emotional,psychological,even
                spiritual. It might look like restricting her ambitions, silencing her opinions or
                slowly pushing her down and lowering her level of confidence</p>
            <p>
                I've seen people fall for women who are confident,driven, and outspoken only for
                the men to later criticize those same traits when they feel threatened or insecure.
                It's as if freedom was attractive until demanded respect, not control
                Today, we talk alot about equality and partnership, but many people regardless of gender
                still stuggle with unlearning deeply rooted Ideas of dominance and submission.
                In some traditions still means obidience.But love shouldn't be about molding someone
                Into a version that makes you feel safe or powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Real intimancy is accepting freedom, not fearing it. Ahealthy relationship lets both
                people grow, not shrink. If someone only loves you for the shining parts of you they
                can dim is it really love or possession?
            </p>
            <p>
                This quote reminds me that we need to examine not just who we're attracted to, but why
                and what we intend to do with the love we had given.

            <h2>Family Love</h2>
            <p>The family love is what held Patricia’s family together because when Patricia was certain that she
                wanted
                a
                baby, the main reason was that she wanted someone who would love her unconditionally. The upbringing
                of
                Trevor was as a form of love because his mother used to support him, teaching him the skills
                required
                for
                him to have a good life, and he used to discipline him so that he would have good manners. Patricia
                was
                very
                keen when it came to her son because he was dedicated to giving him the best of the best. Patricia
                did
                not
                want her son to miss anything this is due to the reason because he used to try and take him to the
                amusement
                park so that he would not miss the joy of childhood. Family love enabled Trevor to be able to talk
                to
                his
                dad even after not being part of her life for such a long time. They were able to rekindle their
                relationship. When Trevor’s mother was sick, Trevor was not at their home. When he was called, he
                was
                able
                to go and pay his mom's medical fees. What led to her mom being hospitalized? She was protecting her
                son
                from being shot by the “husband”. This is a true image of love for family.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                Explaining the quote Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife...but he never fell
                in love with
                subservient women...'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"
                The kind of wife that Abel a subservient wanted is nearly extinct because nowadays the women who are
                present are trying to stand up for themselves and make their own decisions. They do not need men who
                are
                going to monitor and command them around. The days are long gone when women would be left in the
                house
                to tend to house chores, forsaking their careers for family’s sake, allowing the husband to continue
                with their careers. Nowadays, women are empowered and they know what they want and can stand in a
                position to challenge men. Sometimes back, there were roles delegated to men and some to women. For
                instance, technical jobs were mostly left for men, but nowadays we are seeing this tradition being
                abandoned because women are in a position to challenge men, leading to fair competition in the
                industry.
                Careers like engineering were left for men, but nowadays every field of engineering has a
                representation
                of a woman. As they are not proportional, but there is some effort made, and soon the ratio will be
                proportional. When it comes to role swapping, nowadays we can easily find men who can do house
                chores
                efficiently even when the wife is present. This is something that was not there, but now it is
                embraced
                as women can stand for themselves. This is termed as empowerment and having a being recognized in
                the
                future we will have. Apart from that, women need to have their own money and be independent; henc,e
                the
                chances of such women being available are very low because the women are trying to empower each
                other.

            <h2>A mother's Love</h2>
            <p>As much as the book revolves around Trevor and his experience as a mixed person living in apartheid,
                it is clear as day how far this mother was ready to go to give him a life she never had, to open his
                mind up to greater things and opportunities. She opened a new world of possibilities by giving
                Trevor a different perspective on life.
    
                Patricia worked numerous jobs to take him to school and secure his future. She bought him books to
                read and improve his English, taught him how to treat women with respect, and taught him how to have
                a relationship with God. Patricia disciplined Trevor from a place of love to ensure her child
                doesn't get disciplined by the world for the same mistakes.
    
                Patricia never let them sleep hungry, even when she was short on money, she found a way to put
                something on the table. She was selfless and ready to do anything for her children. Patricia let
                Trevor walk away from her when her relationship with Abel started becoming toxic for him to stay.
                She put him ahead of herself even when she lay in a hospital bed with a gunshot wound to the head,
                yet she would ask him not to worry about her.
    
                She was willing to request a coloured woman to walk next to her son as she walked in the back like a
                maid, just to give Trevor a chance to play and see the outside.
    
                She displays the purest form of love that can only be found in a mother.

            <h3>Reflective blog</h3>
            <p>A submissive woman in this day and age has become a thing of the past. Women don't bow down to
                greet their husbands when they come home; they go to offices and work just as hard as men do,
                and even outshine them. Women have broken barriers that existed in the past, they are leaders,
                Engineers, Doctors, and Lawyers. Women have fought for the independence they have gained over
                time it is no longer dominated by men.
                But, society has placed women in predefined boxes; if these expectations go unchecked, a woman
                has officially failed in life. This biased way of living is backward and has been passed by
                time. While women no longer worship their husbands or submit to their every wish, the modern way
                of thinking is just as degrading as it was in the past, only in a different time and way.
                Even though women have made milestones in society, they still lose to men, it is never a race of
                equals, one always has an upper hand. We see these instances in different things that are not
                spoken about, like when a woman is not married or having a child at a certain age, society
                silently judges them, declaring them as failures, regardless of their successes or
                accomplishments. This would not be the case if the roles were to be reversed and a man were the
                one to do the same.
                As much as things have changed and women have more going on for them, it is fair to say men
                still have the upper hand, even in workplaces, for instance where women find they have to work
                twice as hard as men only to achieve less pay compared to men. Women have proven to be more
                competent than men, yet the odds are still stacked against them. </p>

            <h2>The Humerous Inside Tragedy: Asouth African story</h2>
            <p>If I were given the chance to give another title to the book "born a crime", I would have said, "The
                Humorous Inside Tragedy". This suggests a spark of hope and strength which persists even in the
                darkest of times. It clearly defines the invincible spirit of Trevor and his mother who found ways
                to endure the hardships of Apartheid.
            </p>
            <h3>The Cage: Expectations, Freedom, and Control Relationships</h3>
            <p>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife...but he never fell in love with
                subservient women...'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"
                The quote deeply describes the exposing paradox of relationships today. It clearly shows a desire
                for control masked in the name of love. I can briefly explain this in the context of my upbringing
                as a village girl from the northern part of Ethiopia.
                Growing up in my village, community expectations of women were for them to perform household chores.
                Marriages were usually arranged without the consent of the woman and her value was judged by her
                ability to bear children and by the way she cared for her family especially for her husband. The
                words "Freedom and Power" were far from existence in the heads of the women in our village. Despite
                thoseconstraints, some women were defending their individuality, intelligence, and desires. They
                figured out ways to satisfy their desires and wants.
            </p>
            <p>Abel's desire clearly shows the disturbing truth, that the desire for control and power can disguise
                itself as love and as longing for one's partner. Trying to break women's spirit, and diminishing
                them in a cage where men dominated has been a reality for years. When we think of today's world,
                this phenomenon is happening in relationship dynamics, in the workplace, and in different societal
                participation, though it has decreased to some extent. The cage is not only a physical space but it
                also includes the emotional, psychological, and financial situations. As for me, the message I got
                from this quote is that the struggle for equality and true partnership requires courage to break the
                shadows of the past and to stand strong in hardships.

            <h2> THE IRON LADY</h2>
            <p>
                “Abel wanted a traditional wife…but he never fell in love with subservient women…”He only wants a
                woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.Abel uses the norms and beliefs of his
                community to try and make Patricia live according to how women in his community behave. This didn't
                just happen during that time when Trevor wrote the book but it is still happening today, from the
                day we are born our gender is influenced to partake in certain gender roles depending on our sex.Our
                gender consist of whatever behaviours and attitudes a group considers proper for its males and
                females.Males are expected to take more aggressive roles to show power and dominance whereas females
                are expected to partake on more nurturing and subservient roles.In our community ,women should be
                women and men should men.The females are expected to practise their roles right from
                birth.However,if one fails to do so,they are labeled as”not masculine/feminist enough.For example
                boys should not go to the kitchen,it’s the girl/woman’s duty to cook the food ,serve it and even
                take it the ‘men’ regardless of the age.A boy becomes a man as early as possible and he has the
                right to imposed rules on girls around him and the girls are expected to be submissive.Most of them
                claim that “A girl should be trained so that she can go and manage her husband’s home without
                bringing bad reputation to the family’s name”The responsibility of making rules on girls is handed
                over to one’s husband as soon as you are married.It is like we are trapped our entire
                life.Apparently the men have to make the decisions on behalf of everyone and a women have no saying
                in it as the community demand us to do so.

            <h2>From the Black, White and Beyond</h2>
            <p>If I could give “Born a Crime” a new title, it would be “ From the Black, White and Beyond: Navigating a
                divided world.”
                While the existing title is undeniably impactful in drawing attention to the illegality of his birth,
                “From the Black, White and Beyond: navigating a divided world” better describes the reality of race in
                shaping Trevor’s early life. The phrases “black” and “white” literally evoke the racial classifications
                of apartheid. Metaphorically, “black and white” refers to the good and the bad, representing Trevor’s
                experience of both sides of the world. However “and beyond” is crucial because it speaks to his mixed
                race identity.</p>
    
            <h2>A personal blog on reflecting to a quote from “Born a Crime”</h2>
            <p>
                "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife but he never fell in love with a subservient
                woman, He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage"
                The quote is a strange and a very sad thought about how some people perceive most relationships. It
                shows how they want to control someone, in the name of love. This quote highlights how easily people
                fall into social aspects that value a woman that is “free and independent” until she has a husband. Then
                she has to be fully controlled. We see this happening today in many ways.
                Think about a woman who has a good job, but everyone expects her to prioritize her husband's career over
                her own. Or a mom who stays home with her kids, but people judge her for not having her own career. It's
                the idea that a woman should be primarily defined by her relationship and her home life, not for who she
                is as a person.
                From my own experience, I have seen this play out with female family members who were initially praised
                for being ground breakers in their careers, only to face pressure to conform to traditional roles once
                married. Their individuality became a source of tension and conflict.
                Abel’s desire for traditional marriage is not inherently wrong, the contradiction lies in wanting a
                free-spirited partner only to then suppress that spirit. This quote serves as a reminder of the
                importance of recognizing and challenging these paradoxical expectations that limit both men and women,
                and ultimately poison relationships.</p>

            <h2> I would name the book ” Finding Yourself”.</h2>
            <p>
                From the book we see the journey of Trevor Noah as he tries to fit in and wondering why he is different
                until he found out who he wanted to be. At one time, he even asks his mother why they never went to Germany
                because other white kids had told him that they went to Germany because of the apartheid. He thought that if
                he had gone to Germany, he would fit in without the struggle he was going through in their country. In
                school he was confused as to where he should go during break because students were classified according to
                colour and he did not fit to either of the extremes. He was too light for the blacks and he was too black
                for the whites. In the process he learned to use language as he had observed his mother do. He found out
                that language more than skin can be used to define who you are. He used to speak the Xhosa, English,Zulu and
                Afrikaans. He used to talk to the students in their languages and as a result students started interacting
                with him and this made him less of an outsider. Through his interaction with the black students he realized
                that he wanted to be black as compared to being mixed or white. Even when the school insisted that he should
                stay with the white people he fought to stay with the black students. He accepted the fact that the only way
                he could interact with the females was through being funny and he was comfortable with this. With time he
                gained confidence after his acne wore off.</p>
            <h3>Relationship expectations and gender roles</h3>
            <p>
                The quote resonates with relationship expectations in today’s society because some men choose to marry women
                who are independent and free spirited just to make them submissive and exercise their power over them. The
                sole reason they go after such women is because they want to make them change to what the society expects
                and not because they love them. This is what attracts them to a woman and this is also the reason why they
                cannot go for the already submissive women; they want to change the women to be submissive to them and break
                their beliefs so that they can conform to societal expectations.
                At first the men will praise the independence, ambition and intelligence of the women and once they are
                together, they would start talking against the same things they were praising. They would start verbal abuse
                as a joke which would sometimes develop into physical abuse. They would even go ahead and tell them to stop
                working so that they can take care of the kids at home and they expect the woman to obey without any
                question.
    
                This brings in the gender roles associated with women. The women according to the society are supposed to be
                submissive and obedient to the husband. They are also expected to stay at home with the kids, do all the
                cleaning and the laundry while the man is at work. The men on the other hand are believed to be the head of
                the family and so they expect whatever they say to be followed with no questions even when it is not
                favouring the wife. He does not take into account what the wife wants. At some instances the woman becomes
                so dependent on the man that she cannot leave him and ends conforming to the society.
